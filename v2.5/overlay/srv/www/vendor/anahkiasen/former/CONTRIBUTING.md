# Contribution guidelines

Before reporting any issue, please put in the name of your issue a tag specifying the environment you're using Former in :

```
[L3] Problem with X
[L4] Added X to Y
[L5] Feature X request
[Agnostic] etc.
```

If you have a code suggestion, do a pull request against the **develop** branch â€” not **master**.

Don't forget to add a test in the `tests` folder :
- If it's a feature you're adding, add a test proving it works.
- If it's a bug you're fixing, write a test proving it doesn't occur anymore.

Thanks for you input and thanks for using Former !
