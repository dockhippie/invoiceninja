**NOTE:** This repository is part of [Google Cloud PHP](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/google-cloud-php). Any
support requests, bug reports, or development contributions should be directed to
that project.

Use of the included generated clients requires installation of the gRPC PHP extension. For instructions, [see here](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

NOTE: In addition to the gRPC extension, we recommend installing the protobuf extension for improved performance. For installation instructions, [see here](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc#install_the_protobuf_runtime_library).
