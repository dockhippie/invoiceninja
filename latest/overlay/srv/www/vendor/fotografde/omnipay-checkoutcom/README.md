[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements Checkout.com support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "fotografde/omnipay-checkoutcom": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* [Checkout.com](https://checkout.com/)

For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.

### Checkout.js

The Checkout.com integration is fairly straight forward.
Essentially you just pass the order data and receive a payment token, which you
can use in the checkout.js payment form. After your customer has entered his data, you'll receive
another token, which you can use to capture the payment.

Start by following the standard Checkout.com JS guide here:
[http://sandbox.checkout.com/js/v1/docs/Checkout.js_Manual_Sandbox.pdf](http://sandbox.checkout.com/js/v1/docs/Checkout.js_Manual_Sandbox.pdf)

First Authorize:
```php
$response = $gateway->authorize(['amount' => $amount, 'currency' => $currency])->send();
if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    $token = $response->getToken();
}
```

Then Capture:
```php
$response = $gateway->caputure(['amount' => $amount, 'transactionReference' => $token])->send();
if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    // approve Order
}
```
